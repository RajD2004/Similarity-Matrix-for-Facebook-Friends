# Similarity Matrix for Facebook Friends

This project reads a simple social-network file, builds an adjacency list, computes a similarity matrix (mutual-friend counts), and recommends the best new friend for a selected user.

## Files
- `main.py` – program logic  
- `small_network_data.txt` – sample network data

## How to Run
```bash
python3 main.py
